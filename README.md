## Welcome! :wave:

I created this profile to offer a sneak-peek into a few of the more fun and advanced programs that I've worked on. As my skills grow, so, too, will the number of repos here!

Currently, I am a junior at the University of Southern California pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering & Computer Science. My current software- and engineering-related coursework is focusing on:
- network protocols
- APIs
- operating in virtual environments
- HTTP/HTTPS requests
- authentication
- time complexities

I would be happy to answer any questions regarding anything on my profile. I contributed or had full reign over everything you see here!
