## Welcome! :wave:

I created this profile to offer a sneak-peek into a few of the more fun and advanced programs that I've worked on.

As my skills grow, so, too, will the number of repos here!

Currently, my software-related coursework is focusing on:
- network protocols
- APIs
- operating in virtual environments
- HTTP/HTTPS requests
- authentication

I would be happy to answer any questions regarding any of the programs here. I had a hand or full reign over everything you see here!
